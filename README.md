To make code that is both maintainable and readable I try to keep my code clean and organized so thatit can be easily looked through by others. Comments are another important part so that others can understand what the code does.Working this way makes it easier to find errors in my code and also to pick back up where I left off if I had to stop part way through working on something.

This project was more difficult because I am not very experienced with working with databases so learning how to set that up took some time. After that was out of the way though I was able to plan out what I needed to do. 

Computer scientist solve problems when it comes to computers and technology. This isimportant because it helps set up business and people for an easier system to complete their work. This project could help a company by giving them a way to sort and visualize their data for anything depending on the field they are in.
